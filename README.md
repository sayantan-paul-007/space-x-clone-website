Hey Guys, this is my new project which is a static homepage of SpaceX.com. This project is the new start for my series of creating websites. The idea of project sparked out to my mind while I had recieved notification of a new video of Brad Traversy. Unlike other time, this time I tried this project on my own without any reference from video and also took inspiration from the original SpaceX.com website. This project is built by using <strong> HTML, CSS and JQuery </strong><br/>
You can access the site live by the link: https://space-x-clone-website.netlify.app/ <br/>
<h3>Hope you all like my project. If you do so, give a star for the repository </h3><br/>
<h3>THANK YOU AND HAVE A NICE DAY!! FOLKS !!!</h3>
